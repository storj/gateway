----

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that
allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are
encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized
network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to
retrieve those files!
